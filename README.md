# One File 3D World !!!

OneFile3_3DWorld is a simple OpenGL C++ project that demonstrates 3D cube and pyramid rendering in a **single file**. It uses OpenGL 3.3, **Glad** for OpenGL function loading, and **stb_image.h** for image loading. The project is designed to be easy to understand, modify, and run entirely within **Visual Studio**. It also includes a **basic lighting system** to enhance the rendering of 3D shapes.

## Features

- Renders 3D cube and pyramid shapes using OpenGL 3.3.
- Implements a **basic lighting system** to simulate light effects on 3D objects.
- Uses **Glad** to load OpenGL functions.
- Uses **stb_image.h** for texture loading.
- Implemented entirely in **one file**, making it easy to understand and modify.
- Demonstrates basic OpenGL concepts such as transformations, camera handling, and rendering.
- Basic shader program for lighting and texture mapping.
