# One File 3D World !!!

OneFile3_3DWorld is a simple OpenGL C++ project that demonstrates 3D cube and pyramid rendering in a **single file**. It uses OpenGL 3.3, **Glad** for OpenGL function loading, and **stb_image.h** for image loading. The project is designed to be easy to understand, modify, and run entirely within **Visual Studio**. It also includes a **basic lighting system** to enhance the rendering of 3D shapes.

## Features

- Renders 3D cube and pyramid shapes using OpenGL 3.3.
- Implements a **basic lighting system** to simulate light effects on 3D objects.
- Uses **Glad** to load OpenGL functions.
- Uses **stb_image.h** for texture loading.
- Implemented entirely in **one file**, making it easy to understand and modify.
- Demonstrates basic OpenGL concepts such as transformations, camera handling, and rendering.
- Basic shader program for lighting and texture mapping.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio).
- **OpenGL 3.3** libraries.
- **Glad** for OpenGL function loading.
- **stb_image.h** for image loading.

### Installing Dependencies

Before running the project, make sure you have the required libraries:

1. **Glad**: For OpenGL function loading.
   - Download and set up Glad from the [Glad web service](https://glad.dav1d.de/).
   - Choose OpenGL version 3.3 and the language as C/C++.
   
2. **stb_image.h**: A single-header library to load images.
   - Download it from the [stb repository](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h).

### Visual Studio Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/OneFile3DWorld.git
